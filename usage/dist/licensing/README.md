This uses a special maven plugin to create license and notification information,
based on metadata in overrides.yaml and extras.yaml.

First install  https://github.com/ahgittin/license-audit-maven-plugin 
and then, in the usage/dist/ project of Brooklyn...


To see a tree of license info:

    mvn org.heneveld.maven:license-audit-maven-plugin:report \
        -Dformat=summary \
        -DlicensesPreferred=ASL2,ASL,EPL1,BSD-2-Clause,BSD-3-Clause,CDDL1.1,CDDL1,CDDL \
        -DoverridesFile=licensing/overrides.yaml \
        -DextrasFile=licensing/extras.yaml


To create the LICENSE file in the root and in the dist:

    pushd licensing > /dev/null
    ./make-license.sh > LICENSE.autogenerated || ( echo 'FAILED!!!' && rm LICENSE.autogenerated )
    cp LICENSE.autogenerated ../../../LICENSE
    cp LICENSE.autogenerated ../src/main/license/LICENSE
    popd > /dev/null


To generate a CSV:

    mvn org.heneveld.maven:license-audit-maven-plugin:report \
        -Dformat=csv \
        -DlistDependencyIdOnly=true \
        -DsuppressExcludedDependencies=true \
        -DlicensesPreferred=ASL2,ASL,EPL1,BSD-2-Clause,BSD-3-Clause,CDDL1.1,CDDL1,CDDL \
        -DoverridesFile=licensing/overrides.yaml \
        -DextrasFile=licensing/extras.yaml \
        -DoutputFile=dependencies-licenses.csv
