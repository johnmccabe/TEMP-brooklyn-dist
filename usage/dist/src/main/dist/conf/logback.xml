         with INFO threshhold for STDOUT, and noisy categories excluded;

         (or of course replace entirely with your own logback.xml)
         
         the line below defines INFO for root and DEBUG for brooklyn and jclouds;
         for less output, consider including  logback-info.xml  instead then
         define your favourite categories (and/or include logback-favs.xml) -->
