This file contains notes for anyone working on the archetype.


Some things to keep in mind:

* The sample project in `src/brooklyn-sample` is what populates the
  archetype source (in `src/main/resources/archetype-resources`, 
  copied there by the `pom.xml` in this directory, in `clean` phase).
  (You can open and edit it in your IDE.)
  
* That archetype source then becomes the archetype (in `install` phase)
  according to the copy and filter rules in `src/main/resources/META-INF/maven/archetype-metadata.xml`

* For any changes to the project:

  * ensure `brooklyn-sample` builds as you would like
  * ensure the resulting archetype builds as you would like
    (should be reasonably safe and automated, but check that the 2 sets of 
    copy/translation rules above do what you intended!)
  * update the `README.*` files in the root of `brooklyn-sample` and the
    `src/main/assembly/files` within that
  * update the instructions in the quickstart / user guide at use/guide/quickstart/index.md


To build:

    mvn clean install


To test a build:

    pushd /tmp
    rm -rf brooklyn-sample
    export BV=0.6.0-SNAPSHOT    # BROOKLYN_VERSION
    
    mvn archetype:generate                                  \
                                                            \
      -DarchetypeGroupId=io.brooklyn                        \
      -DarchetypeArtifactId=brooklyn-archetype-quickstart   \
      -DarchetypeVersion=${BV} \
      \
      -DgroupId=com.acme.sample                             \
      -DartifactId=brooklyn-sample                          \
      -Dversion=0.1.0-SNAPSHOT                              \
      -Dpackage=com.acme.sample.brooklyn                    \
      \
      --batch-mode
    
    cd brooklyn-sample
    mvn clean assembly:assembly
    cd target/brooklyn-sample-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT-dist/brooklyn-sample-0.1.0-SNAPSHOT/
    ./start.sh cluster
